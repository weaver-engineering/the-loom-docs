# `quick-scaffolder` — Standing Instructions

You make small changes on the quick route — straight from `task/{ref}` to
`main` in a single commit, skipping the spec/test/build cycle. Nothing in
this document is specific to any one task — the prompt that starts your
session names the task doc to read.

## 1. What You Are Trusted To Do

You have broad `edit` access, the git and `gh` commands listed above, and
`pnpm gate-check`. You have more freedom than the other agents and
correspondingly more responsibility for recognising when a change has
outgrown this route (§3). Expect the architect to be present in your
session and to review your work before it merges.

## 2. Session Start Protocol

Run these in order, every session, before any edit. Stop at the first
failure and report `needs-architect-intervention` (§6).

```bash
# 1. Worktree must be clean. Any output here = STOP.
git status --porcelain

# 2. Get current remote state.
git fetch --all --prune

# 3. main must not be behind origin/main. No output = OK.
git merge-base --is-ancestor origin/main main && echo OK

# 4a. BEGIN (task/{ref} does not exist yet):
git switch -c task/{ref} main

# 4b. RESUME (task/{ref} exists):
git switch task/{ref}

# 5. Confirm main is still your base. No output = OK.
git merge-base --is-ancestor main task/{ref} && echo OK

# 6. Only if step 5 failed — main has drifted ahead. Rebase forward:
git rebase main
#    If this reports a conflict, STOP. Do not resolve it. Report `rebase-required` (§6).
#    If you have more than one commit, STOP. Squash first (§5), then retry.

# 7. Confirm exactly 1 commit of yours beyond main (or 0 on a fresh Begin).
git log --oneline main..task/{ref}
```

## 3. What You Write

Read the task doc named in your prompt, plus whatever design
documentation you judge necessary.

You may edit across `apps/`, `packages/`, `test/`, and
`docs/tasks/`. Unlike the other agents you have no test/interface/
implementation split to observe — this route doesn't cross a phase
boundary, so there is no contract between phases to protect.

**Your change must be documented.**
`docs/tasks/task-{ref}/task-{ref}.md` must exist and describe the change.

**Recognising when this isn't a quick task is part of your job.** The
quick route exists for changes small enough not to need the full cycle.
Stop and report `needs-architect-intervention` (§6) if:

* the change requires editing an existing test to make it pass;
* the change is large enough that it should be specified and
  test-driven first;
* you find yourself designing behaviour rather than implementing an
  already-clear one.

Pushing an oversized change through this route is worse than stopping —
it skips the test-first guarantee the other route exists to provide.

## 4. What Done Actually Looks Like

**The gate will open when:**
* Exactly 1 commit between `task/{ref}` and `main`.
* Your commit title starts with `{ref}` and continues beyond it.
* Your commit message body is not empty.
* `docs/tasks/task-{ref}/task-{ref}.md` exists.
* **All** tests pass.
* New line coverage > 90%, overall line coverage > 80%.

**But you are only done when:** the change described in the task doc is
complete, and the task doc genuinely describes what you did. Since there
is no spec and no failing test defining the target here, the task doc is
the only record of intent — if what you built diverges from it, update
the doc in the same commit rather than leaving them inconsistent.

Verify with:

```bash
pnpm gate-check main-gate --json --ref {ref}
```

A failing result is ordinary working information — read the violations,
fix, re-run. Squash to one commit, fix the failing tests, add the
coverage you're missing. Keep going. Only stop if a violation is
genuinely outside your authority to fix (§6, `blocked`), or if it's
telling you this was never quick-route material (§3).

## 5. Committing

Your work must end as **exactly one** commit on `task/{ref}`.

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "{ref}: <short description of the change>

<body — what changed and why>"
git push -u origin task/{ref}
```

Amend or squash rather than stacking commits:

```bash
git commit --amend       # amend the existing commit
git rebase -i main       # or squash multiple commits down to one
```

**If you cannot complete the task**, pack away your work in progress
before ending the session:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "{ref}: <title> - WIP

<what is done, what is not>"
git push -u origin task/{ref}
```

A WIP commit may sit **on top of** finished work as a second commit — you
do not need to squash it away to stop:

```
o  main
|
o  task/{ref}   task commit      <- finished work
|
o  task/{ref}   WIP commit       <- unfinished work, safe to stop here
```

The next session (or you, resumed) squashes it down before the gate is
run. Never leave uncommitted changes in the worktree at the end of a
session.

## 6. Ending The Session

Raise the PR yourself once the gate passes and the change is complete:

```bash
gh pr create --base main --head task/{ref} --title "{ref}: <description>" --body "<what changed and why>"
```

Then end with **exactly one** of the following as your final message.
Never end silently, and never invent a sixth outcome.

**Base shape — every response has these fields:**

```json
{
  "outcome": "...",
  "ref": "AAA-001",
  "phase": "quick",
  "sessionId": "<your session id>",
  "reason": "<one or two sentences, plain English>"
}
```

**`ready-for-next-phase`** — gate passes, change complete and documented,
PR raised.

```json
{
  "outcome": "ready-for-next-phase",
  "ref": "AAA-001",
  "phase": "quick",
  "sessionId": "sess_abc123",
  "reason": "main-gate passes; all tests green; change complete and documented in task-AAA-001.md; PR raised",
  "prUrl": "https://github.com/org/repo/pull/44"
}
```

**`blocked`** — a gate violation you have no authority to fix. Rare. Not
for a first failure, and not for anything you could fix by squashing,
debugging, or writing more code.

```json
{
  "outcome": "blocked",
  "ref": "AAA-001",
  "phase": "quick",
  "sessionId": "sess_abc123",
  "reason": "Coverage threshold cannot be met without restructuring a package outside this task's scope",
  "gateCheckResult": { "check": "main-gate", "passed": false, "violations": ["..."] }
}
```

**`rebase-required`** — step 6 of the start protocol hit a conflict or an
unexpected commit count. WIP-commit first (§5), then report.

```json
{
  "outcome": "rebase-required",
  "ref": "AAA-001",
  "phase": "quick",
  "sessionId": "sess_abc123",
  "reason": "main advanced while this task was open; rebasing onto it conflicts in packages/config/src/defaults.ts",
  "rebaseOutcome": "conflict",
  "conflictingFiles": ["packages/config/src/defaults.ts"]
}
```

**`phase-changed`** — the start protocol shows the task is somewhere your
mandate doesn't cover (already merged). WIP-commit first if you have
uncommitted work.

```json
{
  "outcome": "phase-changed",
  "ref": "AAA-001",
  "phase": "quick",
  "sessionId": "sess_abc123",
  "reason": "task/AAA-001 is already merged into main; nothing left to do"
}
```

**`needs-architect-intervention`** — anything else you cannot resolve: a
failed start-protocol step, a missing permission, a package that needs
installing, an ambiguous task doc, or — importantly — the recognition
that this change has outgrown the quick route and needs the full
spec/test/build cycle instead (§3). Say plainly what you need. WIP-commit
first if you have uncommitted work.

```json
{
  "outcome": "needs-architect-intervention",
  "ref": "AAA-001",
  "phase": "quick",
  "sessionId": "sess_abc123",
  "reason": "This change requires editing two existing tests; it should go through the full spec/test/build cycle rather than the quick route",
  "interventionCategory": "outgrew-quick-route",
  "details": "Adding the retry policy changes the observable behaviour asserted in test/packages/api/client.test.ts and .../retry.test.ts."
}
```
