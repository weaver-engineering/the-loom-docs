# High Level Design - Collaboration & Merge System

## Context

Ported from magpie-weaver's own gate-checks LLD (`magpieweaver-docs/docs/setup/dev-env/gate-checks/gate-checks-lld.md`) as part of WVR-52 — the-loom is now the canonical home of this design, not magpie-weaver's background/glossary/HLD docs, so those cross-links are dropped rather than left dangling.

## 1. System Details

### 1.1 Overview
The set of checks to be run on the CI/CD pipeline.
The checks are a pnpm function `gate-check` which receives the check to run as its first parameter.
It returns 0 if the check passed.
It returns 1 if the check failed.
It returns 2 if the given arguments are not valid.
The first parameter `check-name` is required.
It can optionally output ONLY a JSON document to stdout by specifying the `--json` flag
If the `--json` flag is not given then the logging output of the check is written to stdout.
Arguemnts can be passed to the check from the command line, arguemnts are named `--<arg-name>`.
Argument values follow thier argument name.
Multiple values for a single arguemnt name are interpreted as `string[]`.
Arguement names without values are intepreted as a `boolean true`, so `--isSet` is equivalent to `--isSet true`
Numerical argument values are interpreted as `number` unless there are many when they are interpreted as `string[]`

* Usage `pnpm gate-check <check-name> [--json, --<arg-name> <arg-value>, --list-arg-name <value[0]> <value[1]> <value[2]> ... ]`
* `<check-name>` is always the first arg
* other args can appear in any order

### 1.2 Component Layout

* `packages/gate-checks`       
  * `cli.ts`                  # argument parsing and dispatch only
  * `types.ts`                # shared types
  * `git-interface.ts`        # `GitInspector` interface to abstract the call to `simpleGit` from the check logic for testing.
  * `git-inspector.ts`        # implementation of `GitInspector` using `simpleGit`
  * `coverage-interface.ts`   # `ConverageInspector` interface to abstract the call to pnpm 
  * `coverage-inspector.ts`   # implementation of `CoverageInspector` using pnpm and reading from `coverage`
  * `checks`
    * `index.ts`              # registry mapping name -> check function
    * `branch-ref.ts` # individual function components
    * `pr-title`              # each function may receive params from command line
    * `get-inbound-commits`   # each function async and returns a `Promise<GateCheckResult>`
    * `validate-spec-commit`  # or not async and returns a `GateCheckResult`
    * `validate-test-commit`
    * `validate-build-commit`
    * `validate-task-commit`
    * `existing-tests-pass`
    * `new-tests-fail`
    * `coverage`
    * `test-gate`
    * `build-gate`
    * `main-gate`

## 3. Design Notes
* Wherever the design mentions `{ref}` the `{ref}` must conform to regex `[A-Z]+-[0-9]+` 
* When a function 'exposes' values they are included in the `GateCheckResult.values` map.
* specification files names match regex `^task-[A-Z]+-[0-9]+(-[0-9]+)?(-[a-z])?-spec\.md$`
* All functions receive an instance of `Inspectors` as the first argument to facilitate testing.
* Functions record their arguments in `GateCheckResult.args`
* Functions log messages to `GateCheckResult.messages`
* Functions log violations to `GateCheckResult.vilolations`
* Functions log their check state passed: true -> passed, false -> failed
* The functions may only use the `GitInspector` for git operations
* The functions may only use the `CoverageInspector` for coverage operations 
* Unit testing via mocking `GitInspector` and `CoverageInspector`
* `GitInspector` & `CoverageInspector` implementations not covered by unit test.
* CLI usage `pnpm gate-check <check-name> [--json, --<arg-name> <arg-value>, --list-arg-name <value[0]> <value[1]> <value[2]> ... ]`
* `<check-name>` is always the first arg
* other args can appear in any order


## 4. Component Details

### 4.1 cli.ts
* The CLI entry point
* Gets the <check-name> and any args from the command line
* Uses the command registry `index.ts` to get the function by name from the function catalog.
* writes a failed `GateCheckResult` to stdout if invalid arguments with return val 2 (invalid arguments, no <check-name> not given, check not found, required args missing)
* Calls the function with the inspectors and given arguments
* if `--json` flag is given in args

### 4.2 types.ts
* Defines all the common types used by `gate-checks`
